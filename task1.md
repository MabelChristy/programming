Tried solving practice questions:

C Basics:

1)Write a C program that asks the user to enter two numbers and then prints their sum.

Arrays: 

2) Write a C program to find the largest element in an array of integers.

For Loop: 

3) Write a C program to display the multiplication table of a given number using a for loop.

If Statement: 

4) Write a C program that reads an integer from the user and prints "Positive" if it's greater than zero, "Negative" if it's less than zero, and "Zero" if it's equal to zero.

While Loop: 

5) Write a C program to find the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

Switch Statement: 

6) Write a C program to input a number (1-7) from the user and print the corresponding day of the week using a switch statement.

Nested If Statement: 

7) Write a C program that reads three numbers from the user and prints the largest number using nested if statements.
